I worked on setting up Stopper superclass, with the necessary methods. I also set up the subclasses of Bell, Bumper, Flipper, and Wall.

### 2023-05-23

I worked on the constructors for the subclasses of Stopper. I merged my changes into the main. We worked on merging our changes in order to prevent errors from occurring in future iterations.

I started to work on the Ball class by making its instance variables, the constructor, and the beginning of the applyForce method.

### 2023-05-23

I finished the first version of the Ball, and made Machine the main class instead of Ball. I also added bounciness to Stopper's constructor and the methods that will be used whenever a ball collides with a Stopper object. I started to incorporate hitboxes into the Stopper constructors.

## 2023-05-24

I started working on the Flipper class more in-depth by adding instance variables methods that will be used when the flipper is swung. Came up with idea to use 2d int arrays (sets of coordinates) as hitboxes for Stoppers.
