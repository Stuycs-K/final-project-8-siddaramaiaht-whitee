# APCS Final Project
THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED
## Group Info
## Overview
This project is an arcade-like 2D pinball game with two flippers controlled by the player that also have adjustable swing force. The player can score point by hitting colorful bells that are worth different amounts of points. The goal is to score as many points as you can before gravity pulls the ball down passed the flippers. We made the physics of the ball and its collisions with the pinball machine's obstacles to be as accurate as we could get them.
## Instructions
Press space bar to swing the flippers.
Press the up/down arrow keys to increase/decrease the force of the flippers, which is displayed by the bar on the right.
Press 'q' to quit and/or to retry with the same layout of bells after you have lost and the Game Over screen is displayed.
Press 'r' to retry with a different layout of bells.
Press 'm' to play with multiple balls.
